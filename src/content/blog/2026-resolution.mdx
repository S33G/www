I’m a software engineer. I don’t do social networking, mostly because I enjoy a private life.. But I still want to talk about what I do, what I’m building, and what I’m learning — without turning it into a performance.

So here’s the resolution: **in 2026, I will write more.**

More software, more notes, more reflections. More sharing of what I’m working on, how I’m solving problems, and what I’m exploring.

This blog is where I’ll do it — casual, professional, and focused on the work.

## Topic's I'll (likely) cover

- Software engineering practices and patterns
- Tools and utilities I build
- Tech I’m exploring
- Personal projects in progress
- Homelab experiments and automation
- My outdoor exploration & photography
- Drones / FPV builds and flying

## What I’m not doing

No oversharing. No doomscrolling. No chasing metrics. I’m here to document, reflect, and ship ideas that might help someone else.

## If you’re reading this

Thanks for stopping by. I’ll keep things tight, useful, and honest. If a post is half-baked, I’ll say so. If something works well, I’ll share the recipe. And if I change my mind, I’ll update it.

Here’s to writing the posts.
