I built `github-fork-manager` because the GitHub UI makes it intentionally hard to delete lots of repositories. That’s the right trade-off for most people. But if you’re the type who prototypes, forks, and experiments a lot, the clutter adds up fast.

I wanted a deliberate, terminal-native tool that makes cleanup possible **without** removing the guardrails. It’s powerful, but it’s not casual.

- Repo: https://github.com/S33G/github-fork-manager

## Why I did it

- GitHub’s UI is designed to prevent mass deletion (for good reason).
- I had dozens of old forks and one-off experiments to prune.
- I wanted a fast, repeatable workflow.

## What I built

A TUI (terminal UI) that lists your forks (or owned repos), lets you filter and multi-select, and then deletes in a safe, logged sequence—with a confirmation phrase required before anything destructive happens.

## What I used

- **[Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/)** for speed, portability, and easy cross-platform builds
- **[GitHub REST API v3](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)** for repo management
- **[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)** for the TUI runtime
- **[Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)** for ready-made TUI components
- **[Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)** for styling the terminal UI
- **TUI + keyboard navigation** for fast, repeatable workflows
- **Logging** to `~/.github-fork-manager/actions.log` for auditability

## How it works (high level)

1. Load config or environment (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, optional `api_base`).
2. Fetch repos (forks by default, owned repos with `--non-forks`).
3. Render list with filter + multi-select.
4. Require explicit confirmation text: `<username> approves`.
5. Delete sequentially, log each action, show progress + errors.

## A note on safety

This tool is dangerous in the wrong hands. It deletes repositories — permanently.
I’m assuming you understand what you’re doing, you scope your token correctly, and you’re comfortable with the consequences.

If that sounds too sharp, don’t use it. If it sounds useful, read the README, run it carefully, and start with a small selection.

## Want to contribute?

Issues and PRs are welcome. If you see a sharp edge or have an idea to make the workflow safer or smoother, open a ticket and let’s improve it.
